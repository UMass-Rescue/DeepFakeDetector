# DeepFakeDetector

Project currently in development. ImageModel used python 3.10 and is located here - https://github.com/fedeloper/binary_deepfake_detection.

To run the image model - clone this repo and the repo linked above. Copy the image_model files to the same location as the git clone of above repo. Now, through conda, create a new environment with python 3.10. Install all requirements through pip and the requirements.txt file (in linked repo). You will also need to install flask-ml and retinaface through pip. More detailed instructions are being worked on.
